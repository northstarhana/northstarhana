This is my blog where I share knowledge that I find useful for software development, primarily within Unreal Engine.
Epic's docs leave much to be desired and the internet is riddled with accidental misinformation. I wish to remedy this by having an open reference for both the early "gotchas" and obscure parts of the Engine that may not have much public material available.

I recommend the extension SingleFile ([Firefox-based browsers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/single-file/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search) | [Chromium-based browsers](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/singlefile/mpiodijhokgodhhofbcjdecpffjipkle)) to save articles that you may find useful as a single .html file. Feel free to share this information as you see fit, but linking back to this site is appreciated so that others may find other articles that they may find useful.
